        "* Because the population error cannot be observed directly,the test error serves as a statistical estimator of it.\n",
        "* Because each prediction is a Bernoulli random variable, the test error is the sample mean of i.i.d(independent indentically distributed) random variables and thus an unbiased estimator of the popolation error.\n",
        "* By the central limit theorem, this estimate converges to the true error at the rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{n})$, meaning that improving precision requires larger test sets.\n",
        "* The variance of the estimate depends on the true error rate and is maximized near 0.5, giving a worst-case bound on uncertainity.\n",
        "* As a result, estimating error within $+/- 0.01$ with high confidence requires thousands to tens of thousands of test samples.\n",
