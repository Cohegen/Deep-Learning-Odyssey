# 03 - Linear Neural Networks  for classification

Welcome — this is the new folder for linear neural networks applied to classification tasks.

Planned contents:
- `01-intro.ipynb` — Overview and intuition for using linear models for classification (logistic regression, softmax).
- `02-dataset.ipynb` — Prepare datasets (binary and multiclass examples).
- `03-training.ipynb` — Training loops, loss functions (cross-entropy), accuracy metrics.
- `assets/` — any images/plots used by notebooks.

Starter checklist:
1. Add notebooks above.
2. Add datasets or download scripts.
3. Add tests/examples comparing regression vs classification.

If you prefer actual file moves/renames of existing directories (instead of these wrapper folders), tell me and I will rename/move files instead (I can do that but will need to copy the files into the new paths).
